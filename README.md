# Satoshi Wallets

## GetBlocksData.py:
This application enables the extraction of wallet addresses and public keys from Bitcoin blocks, listing them as text.
The application has already been executed for the first 33,000 blocks, and the corresponding data is available in the "Data" directory as Excel files.

## SatoshiWalletPublicKeysPoints.py:
This application reads the x and y coordinates of public keys from a CSV file and visualizes them.
An example output is shown below.

Satoshi is signaling the message '2' through the wallets he created.
Could this be a sign that one day he might send 2 BTC to say 'I'm alive'?
Satoshi, if you're alive, could you send 2 BTC to the wallet below? I want to try something.
Thus, after Hal Finney, you will have made your second known transaction to the person who noticed the '2' signal in your wallets.
